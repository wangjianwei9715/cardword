/// Enables or disables custom video rendering.
///
/// Available since: 1.9.0
/// Description: When enable is `YES`,video custom rendering is enabled; if the value of `NO`, video custom rendering is disabled.
/// Use case: Use beauty features or apps that use a cross-platform interface framework (for example, Qt requires a complex hierarchical interface to achieve high-experience interaction) or game engines (for example, Unity3D, Cocos2d-x), etc.
/// Default value: Custom video rendering is turned off by default when this function is not called.
/// When to call: Must be set after [createEngine] before the engine starts, before calling [startPreview], [startPublishingStream],[startPlayingStream].The configuration can only be modified after the engine is stopped, that is, after [logoutRoom] is called.
/// Caution: Custom video rendering can be used in conjunction with custom video capture, but when both are enabled, the local capture frame callback for custom video rendering will no longer be triggered, and the developer should directly capture the captured video frame from the custom video capture source.
/// Related callbacks: When developers to open a custom rendering, by calling [setCustomVideoRenderHandler] can be set up to receive local and remote video data to be used for custom rendering. [onCapturedVideoFrameRawData] local bare preview video frame data correction, distal pull flow [onRemoteVideoFrameRawData] naked video frame data correction.
